# Blow_Up_Just_Right


## controls

Blow Up Just Right is a javascript game made using canvas. The controls are simply clicking, holding, and releasing in any position on the screen. This will move the ball to the position where you click, inflate the ball as you hold the click, and let the ball drop when you release the click. 

## gameplay
The goal is to drop the ball between the two poles that flash at this bottom of the screen, like in the gif below. The larger the ball you managed to get between the posts, the more points you are awarded for that drop. In the top right corner you can see the score award to you last drop (max score is 100, representing a rounded up percentage of the space between the posts you took up with the ball), as well as the total score you have accumulated.

Hitting pole will be rewarded no points and will display a message in the last drop line.

Simalarly, dropping the ball outside of the space between the posts will be rewarded no points and display a message in the last drop line.

Pressing the spacebar will start a timed mode which will last 30 seconds. The goal is to score as many points as you can within this 30 second time frame. At the end of the time frame the ball will automatically be dropped, and a message will flash on the screen indicating if you have beaten your highest score since visiting the page, where it will remain displayed in the top right corner.

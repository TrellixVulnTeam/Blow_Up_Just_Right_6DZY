# Blow_Up_Just_Right

Background and Overview
This game will consist of two vertical lines being generated at a random distance apart at the bottom of the screen, and an area to click in the top of the screen to create a small circle that expands while you continue to hold the click. When the you release the click the circle will stop expanding a fall down toward between the two vertical lines. The goal is to get the biggest circle possible to fall between the two vertical lines, without making it too big as to touch one of the lines.
